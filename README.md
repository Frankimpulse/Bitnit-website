# Bitnit 🚀

Bitnit is a simple crypto-themed landing website built for learning, experimentation, and presentation purposes.

This project is **not a real cryptocurrency** and does not represent a live blockchain, token, or financial product. It exists purely as a frontend and basic backend integration demo.
